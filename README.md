# Xilinx-XDMA-Host-Software
## Intro
This repo provides program running on host PC for writing/reading data to/from Xilinx FPGA device which connected with host PC through [PCIe-XDMA](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg195-pcie-dma/Introduction). The provided program for writing /reading supports both AXI-Memory-Map and AXI-Stream DMA interface configurations.
