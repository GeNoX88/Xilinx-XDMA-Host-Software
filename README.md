# Xilinx-XDMA-Host-Software
## Intro
This repo provides program running on host PC with Xilinx FPGA as PCIe peripherals, which writes/reads data to/from FPGA device through [PCIe-XDMA](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/en-US/pg195-pcie-dma/Introduction). The provided program supports both AXI-Memory-Map and AXI-Stream interface configurations of XDMA IP.

## Get Started
This part introduces how to set up host PC and run program to write/read data to/from FPGA devices.
### Get Source Codes
Clone this repo to your host PC:
```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/GeNoX88/Xilinx-XDMA-Host-Software.git
```
This command also downloads offical XDMA driver from [dma_ip_drivers](https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers).

Compile XDMA driver and host program:
```
# Switch to the root directory of this repo
$ cd $(Xilinx-XDMA-Host-Software)

# Compile host program 
# The generated executable is located in ./bin/
$ make host

# Compile XDMA driver
$ make driver
```

### Load XDMA Driver
Before loading XDMA driver, you have to check that your FPGA device has been recognized by the host PC as a PCIe peripheral. You can run `lspci` command and check if there is:
```
...                                                           # other devices
02:00.0 Memory controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 7021     # Xilinx PCIe-XDMA(AXI-MM)
...                                                           # other devices
```
Or:
```
...                                                           # other devices
02:00.0 Serial controller: Xilinx Corporation Device 7021     # Xilinx PCIe-XDMA(AXI-Stream)
...                                                           # other devices
```
In most cases, once FPGA is programed by a new bitstream file, you need to reboot your host PC so that it can rescan PCIe devices and find your FPGA. But if your FPGA has been recognized successfully before and you don't change the **PCIe:Bars** configuration of XDMA in the new bitstream, you can just run following commands to rescan PCIe devices:
```
$ sudo -i
$ echo 1 > /sys/class/pci_bus/0000:02/device/remove
$ echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan
$ exit
```
After executing commands above, you need to run `lspci` again and if you still can't find your FPGA, you'd better try to reboot your host PC. 
**Note**: you may need to change `0000:02` to the number corresponding to your FPGA device. You can find these number from the output of `lspci`.

Once you have check that your FPGA is recognized by host PC successsfully after programmed by a new bitstream, you can load XDMA driver by:
```
# Switch to the following directory
$ cd ./dma_ip_drivers/XDMA/linux-kernel/tests/
# Load driver in the sudo mode
$ sudo ./load_driver.sh
```
If successful, you can see the following output:
```
interrupt_selection .
xdma                  110592  0
Loading driver...insmod xdma.ko interrupt_mode=2 ...

The Kernel module installed correctly and the xmda devices were recognized.
DONE
```
And you can also find files corresponding to XDMA channels under `/dev` directory, which are written/read by our host program to communicate with FPGA:
```
$ ls /dev/xdma*
...
/dev/xdma0_c2h_0
...
/dev/xdma0_h2c_0
```

### Run Read/Write Software
After loading XDMA driver successfully, you can run our host program to read/write data from/to your FPGA deivce. The executable of host program is located in `./bin` directory and its detailed usage is as follows:

```
Usage: ./xdma_rw [OPTIONS]

The available options are as follows:
   -r/w   Specify read/write from/to XDMA (mandatory option).
   -h     Display help information.
   -d device_name
          Specify the device name, default device name:
          Write - /dev/xdma0_h2c_0
          Read - /dev/xdma0_c2h_0
   -f file_name
          Specify the name of file to be read/write.
   -s byte_num
          Specify the size of one transaction(default: 32).
   -c trans_num
          Specify the total number of transactions(default: 1).
   -a address
          Specify the start address on the AXI bus(Only for AXI-MM)
```
**Note**: the size of specified file should be equal to (byte_num * trans_num) bytes.

Example:
```
# Switch to the root directory of this repo
$ cd $(Xilinx-XDMA-Host-Software)

# Read 4KB data from XDMA(AXI-Stream) to output_data.bin through 4 1KB-transactions.
$ sudo ./xdma_rw -r -f ./output_data.bin -s 1024 -c 4

# Write 1MB data from input_data.bin to XDMA(AXI-Stream) through 512 2KB-transactions.
$ sudo ./xdma_rw -w -f ./input_data.bin -s 2048 -c 512
```
### Simple Loopback Test
A script that automatically performs loopback tests on XDMA is also provided in this repo. It assumes that XDMA is configured in the AXI-Stream mode, and what user logic in FPGA does is just to pass data received from h2c channel back to c2h channel. In this script, you can specify the size and number of transactions to be written/read to/from FPGA. And the script first generates binary file containing random data of the specified size, writes these data to XDMA h2c channel, receives loopback data from c2h channel, and finally check if data read from XDMA is consistent with data written to it before.
```shell
$ sudo ./loopback_test.sh
```
